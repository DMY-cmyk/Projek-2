- Dataset: `data/processed/panel_dataset.csv`
- Residual source: pooled OLS approximation `price ~ roa`
- Firms (N): 2
- Pair count: 1
- CD statistic: 1.414214
- Note: with only 2 firms and 2 years, this is only a pilot diagnostic and not a final inference basis.

## Pairwise residual correlation
- TECHA vs TECHB: rho = 1 (T overlap = 2)
