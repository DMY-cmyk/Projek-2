# Indonesia vs US Context Discussion (Supplementary)

## Scope
- This is supplementary analysis from existing SEC cache and current Indonesia panel file.
- It is descriptive, not causal inference.

## Market Maturity
- US sample (large-cap tech) shows mature scale and generally stronger profitability consistency.
- Indonesia tech sample is still early-stage with fewer long-listed issuers and higher listing recency.

## Regulation and Reporting Context
- US firms report under SEC regime with long disclosure history and broader analyst coverage.
- Indonesia firms operate under BEI/OJK disclosure environment with heterogeneous annual-report depth for AI topics.

## AI Adoption Context
- US mega-cap firms adopted AI investments earlier and at larger capex/intangible scale.
- Indonesia ICT issuers are in mixed adoption stages; AI disclosure intensity likely varies by sub-sector.

## Interpretation Guardrails
- Current Indonesia dataset in repo is still pilot-sized, so significance comparison between markets is not statistically reliable yet.
- Final comparative inference should be rerun after full Indonesia panel dataset is completed.
